	 <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">
                <p class="big">
                  Transcription factors (TF) are proteins that bind to a target site on chromatin and orchestrate transcription. We try to model the interphase chromatin as a network where each bead of the simulated polymer acts as a node and the TF as an unbiased random walker, hopping to other nodes in the neighborhood. From existing literature on the network, it is known that the mean first passage time (MFPT) of a random walker between any two nodes on a general network follows a set of particular scaling laws.
                <p/>

        <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">
                <p class="big">
                <li> Our main goal is to verify whether the MFPT scaling law (for a network) holds in the chromatin context, i.e., the possibility of characterizing the MFPT of a TF based on walk dimension and fractal dimension of chromatin mesh.</li>

		<li>The biologically relevant question is, if a TF is stuck inside a wrong TAD (chromatin mesh with no target site), how long it would take to come out of it. In other words, we are trying to figure out the dependence of mean exit time from a TAD on the size of the domain (radius of gyration) and structure of this domain.</li>

		<li>It is now well accepted that chromatin are dynamic polymers. This dynamic nature arises due to the tethering of chromatin to the nuclear lamina, the interplay of interactions with various proteins, and the dynamic loop extrusion process via cohesin.Previous works show that the performance of a random walker (walking on polymer) is increased if the polymer has its dynamics. The mean square displacement of a random walker along a static polymer shows only diffusive behavior, whereas polymer dynamics can make the walk superdiffusive. It will be interesting to see whether chromatin dynamics can reduce the TF's mean target search time (or mean exit time from a TAD).</li>

                <li>Effect of collapsed structure: Chromatin is a collapsed polymer and it makes frequent contact with itself. TF can jump to distant loci if there are contacts between far-away loci. We constructed an artificial domain where each locus is making contacts with other loci with a constant probability. Mean exit time from the domain for a random walker shows a non-monotonic behavior. If the contact probability is small, the walk is only along the 1D chain and can not hop to distant loci. Again, if contact probability is very high, there are too many contacts for each locus and the walker takes more time to reach the domain boundary.</li>

		<li>Exit time analysis: We constructed an ensemble of connectivity matrices (C<sub>ij</sub>) (with entries 1 and 0) for a region on human chromosome 7 according to the available Hi-C contact matrix. A random walker was allowed to walk on the network following the connectivity matrix (i.e. only if C<sub>ij</sub>=1, jump is allowed between i and j ). The chosen region consists a TAD and we calculated exit time distribution. Simulation have shown that total mean exit time from a bigger domain is less than sum of mean exit times from the sub-domains.</li>

		<li>Exit time scaling: We collected more TAD structures from the Hi-C map in order to find out a proper scaling of mean exit times with TAD lengths.</li>

		<li>Finite-size of the TAD: As discussed earlier, Our goal is to calculate mean exit time scaling with the size of the domain. However, the actual TAD size varies in the range 0.5Mbp to 2Mbp. Hence, getting a scaling law remains a challenge with the available data.</li>

 <h4 class="titles">Investigating the role of Lamin interactions in regulating chromatin organisation</h4>
        

	 <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">
                <p class="big">
                 Lamins are principal nucleoskeletal proteins of all mammalian cells, which impart rigidity to nuclear morphology and ensure the resilience
of the nucleus by forming filamentous meshwork under the inner nuclear membrane, called nuclear lamina [1]. Over the recent years,
mutations in lamins have been found to cause a cluster of human diseases, collectively termed laminopathies (e.g., dilated cardiomyopathy
(DCM) [1], Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome [2] etc.). One of the significant features of such mutations is the abrupt disappearance
of the nuclear lamina and the formation of multiple lamin aggregates in the nucleoplasm. In this study, we perform coarse-grained
simulations (using LAMMPS) of a small region near the membrane of the nucleus to investigate the role of interactions between different
nuclear components (chromatin, lamin and nuclear membrane) in WT cells and possible changes in those interactions which can lead to
a mutant configurations.

	<h4 class="titles">Improved chromatin models using systematic coarse-graining data</h4>
        

	 <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12">
                <p class="big">
                  Coarse-grained chromatin models are essential to interpret various experimental observations and predicting physical principles behind
chromatin organization. Most existing polymer models consider chromatin as an array of beads connected by springs. Each bead
represents chromatin segments of genomic length 1 kbp to 1 Mbp (depending on the context). Models also assume various polymer
properties as input, such as the spring constant of the connecting spring between beads, bending rigidity, coarse-grained bead sizes,
equilibrium bond lengths between neighboring beads, equilibrium angles between three consecutive beads etc. In a recent study, using
extensive simulations, we have predicted these quantities essential for the polymer representation of chromatin.

Modeling chromatin as a FRC polymer
Using the distribution of bond angles and bond lengths from systematic coarse-graining, we ask whether chromatin-like polymer config-
urations can be generated by incorporating these coarse-grained parameters into simple polymer models. We construct a freely rotating
chain (FRC) polymer using these parameters. We show that while it is possible to generate TAD-like domains as seen from the FRC
model, and also the average 3D distance between the same genomic loci matches with experimentally observed values, there is a significant
deviation of the scaling of the radius of gyration with the genomic length for this FRC polymer from experimentally observed data. This
disagreement indicates that “only” heterogeneous bond lengths and angles are not sufficient to model chromatin segments, and we must
construct polymer models incorporating the effects of soft interaction potential and sequence heterogeneity

  <h4 class="titles">Recombination</h4>

                <p class="big">
                  One of the major reasons for the diversity of living beings is the biological process of recombination—two parts of the broken DNA meet together and exchange. This phenomenon can give rise to entirely new species during evolution. What is the rate of recombination has been an important question historically. Since chromatin is a polymer and recombination requires the physical proximity of two chromatin segments, this question cannot be entirely answered until we incorporate the chromatin 3D organization into our calculations. Recent advances in experimental techniques have led to new chromatin conformation capture experiments (3C, Hi-C). It provides us the probability that two chromatin segments are in contact. We plan to use this and predict the recombination frequency under various conditions.

                   Our questions: what is the probability that two loci (with the same sequence identity) from two different chromatin come into the vicinity and recombine: 

		<li>If chromatin is modeled as a random walk polymer.</li>

		<li>If chromatin is modeled as a self-avoiding walk (SAW) polymer.</li>

		<li>If chromatin is modeled as a compact polymer with similar folding as seen in experimental data.</li> 

The first two cases are control scenarios that allow us to analyze the effect of the specific organization of chromatin on the recombination process. Moreover, searching for another exact copy of chromatin segment requires extensive scanning. However, the process takes only tens of minutes to a few hours. To explain the surprisingly fast time-scale of recombination, one may need to introduce new interactions. Also, dependence on the length of the chromosome can be interesting to study.
